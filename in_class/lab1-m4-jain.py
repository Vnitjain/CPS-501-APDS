# Question 1 : Area of rectangle

# defining the height and width of the rectangle
height_of_rectangle = 12
width_of_rectangle = 13

# calculating the area of the rectangle and assigning it to a variable
area_of_rectangle = height_of_rectangle * width_of_rectangle

# printing the area variable into the console
print("The area of the rectangle is : " + str(area_of_rectangle))


# Question 2 : Area of circle

# asking for the input radius of the circle and typecasting to float
radius_of_circle = float(input("Please enter the radius of circle : "))

# declaring the value of constant pi
PI = 22 / 7

# calculating the area of circle and assigning it to a variable
area_of_circle = PI * (radius_of_circle**2)

# printing the area of circle into the console
print("The area of the circle is : " + str(area_of_circle))
